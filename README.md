# Vanilla caves

Vanilla Caves is a datapack that disables the noise-based cave generation introduced in the Caves & Cliffs update.

With this datapack, only the classic carver-based cave system remains, restoring the simpler and more structured cave networks from pre-1.18 Minecraft.  
It is ideal for players who prefer the old-school cave layout.

## Features

- Disables all noise-based caves (spaghetti caves, cheese caves, etc.)
- Restores classic carver-based cave generation only
  - Slightly enlarged caves
  - Reduced number of surface cave entrances
  - Increased frequency of underground caves
- Only affects newly generated chunks
- No other terrain features are changed

## Installation

- Download the [datapack](https://github.com/Neluxx/vanilla-caves/releases/latest)
- Move the datapack inside ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks`` ([How to find .minecraft?](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft#Locating))
- Reload the world or run ``/reload``
