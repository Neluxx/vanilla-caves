# Vanilla caves

Vanilla Caves is a datapack that disables the noise-based cave generation introduced in the Caves & Cliffs update.
With this pack, only the classic cave system remains â€” restoring the simpler, more structured cave networks from pre-1.18 Minecraft.
Ideal for players who prefer the old-school cave layout.

## Features

- Disables all noise caves (spaghetti caves, cheese caves, etc.)
- Restores classic carver-based cave generation only
- Only affects newly generated chunks
- No other terrain features are changed

## Installation

- Download the [datapack](https://github.com/Neluxx/vanilla-caves/releases/latest)
- Move the datapack inside ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks`` ([How to find .minecraft?](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft#Locating))
- Reload the world or run ``/reload``

## Uninstalling

- Delete the datapack from ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks``

> **_NOTE:_** Newly generated terrain after removal will include noise caves again
